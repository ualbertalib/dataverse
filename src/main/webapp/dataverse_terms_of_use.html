<p>You shall abide by all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>As a condition to using Services, you are registering with UAL Dataverse Network using your UofA CCID and
    password. You shall provide UAL with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. Failure to do so
    shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your UAL Dataverse
    Network account. You shall not (i) select or use as a UAL Login Name a name of another person with the intent to
    impersonate that person; (ii) use as a UAL Login Name a name subject to any rights of a person other than you
    without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a UAL Screen Name a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or
    obscene. UAL reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a UAL Screen Name in its sole discretion. You

    confidentiality of your password. You shall never use another user's account without such other user's express
    permission. You will immediately notify UAL in writing of any unauthorized use of your account, or other account
    related security breach of which you are aware.</p>
<h4>User Submissions</h4>
<p>The Service provides you with the ability to upload, submit, disclose, distribute or otherwise post (hereafter,
    "posting") content (including, without limitation, information, data, and images) to the Service ("User
    Submissions") and to allow other users to do so. The Service provides you with the ability to display, organize, and
    accept content through creating a Dataverse.</p>
<p>The Services also provides you with the ability to post User Submissions to other Dataverses administered by
    third parties ("Third-Party Dataverse Administrator"), subject to the permissions and terms of use required by those
    Third Party Dataverse Administrators. User Submissions posted to third party Dataverse are also subject to curation
    by ("Curated By") the Third-Party Dataverse Administrator for that dataverse.</p>
<p>An important part of the mission of UAL is to acquire and preserve research data and provide access to it. UAL
    intends to create archival versions of the Content that will facilitate preservation, verification, management, and
    use, and to permanently archive these versions of the Content at multiple locations. UAL will use good archival
    practices, as identified by UAL, to retain and preserve Content deposited into the Site. Notwithstanding, you
    acknowledge that UAL and Third-Party Dataverse Administrators will not be liable for any loss of or damage to the
    User Submissions, either in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the UAL does not review data submissions before they are made available to the public, so
    we may only accept data that is publicly distributable. BEFORE YOU CONTRIBUTE DATA TO THE ARCHIVE, YOU MUST ENSURE
    THAT THE DATA MEETS OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If your data does not meet our terms and conditions, the Archive is
    unable to accept your data. You will be held legally and financially responsible for the Archive's damages if data
    you contribute violates these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>By posting User Submissions on or at the Site, or otherwise through the Service, to your Dataverse or other
    Dataverses, or by allowing others to do so, you make the following representations and warranties to UAL and to the
    administrator of that Dataverse:</p>
<ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>You will promptly notify both UAL and the administrator of the dataverse curating the User Submissions

            system, data or other information of UAL or any third party.</p>
    </li>
